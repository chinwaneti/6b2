                &quot;Wisdom is a mixture of experience, courage and intelligence. We all want to be wise and make wise decisions, because when we do, <br> we're tapping into the best of ourselves. Quite often, being wise is just giving ourselves enough
                time to think (isn't it quite often the case that snap judgement turn out poorer results than considered decisions!). <br> Listening to wise counsel - to wise friends and mentors, who give us a more balanced perspective when we're mulling
                over an idea - is a good way to tap into wiser choices. <br> So let these Wise Quotes remind us of life lessons that bring us wisdom and build our character. Be inspired and encouraged by these words of wisdom! &quot;
